<body>
My name is Drew Grossman and I am a student at Syracuse University. I am currently undecided in the school of Arts and Sciences but I am looking to transfer into the ischool next semester. I am a very handy person and I love to use technology. I love to watch sports and I am a huge Mets fan. I also enjoy watching a good movie every now and then.
